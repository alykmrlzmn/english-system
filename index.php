        <center><h2><b>DOES GOOD PRONUNCIATION MAKES SENSE?</h2></b></center>
        <b>
      Good pronunciation will boost your confidence.
      You will be able to participate in discussions and get to know your classmates and those around you better.In this way, having good pronunciation can even help you make more friends faster. Speaking will no longer be a difficult process, but rather a pleasurable way to improve your English while making meaningful connections with other. Pronunciation is about making sure you sound clear and understandable. Others can quickly understand what you're trying to say if you use the correct sounds when speaking. If you have excellent grammar and a wide vocabulary, good pronunciation will allow others to hear and understand you more clearly.
